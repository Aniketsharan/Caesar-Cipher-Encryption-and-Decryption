# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-and-Decryption
This C++ program implements a simple Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions to the right (for encryption) or left (for decryption) to produce the ciphertext.
